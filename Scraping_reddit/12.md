What's the best way to scrape competitor product data accurately?
Hey folks, I run a small fashion brand and I’m trying to get better at benchmarking products across competitor websites.

I’ve tried scraping tools, they’re decent for scraping basic info like product names and prices, but they totally miss details like what sizes or colors are in stock, and even product-specific features.

This kind of info is super important for benchmarking and understanding how our collections compare.

Has anyone found a tool or method that actually works well for this? I’m open to custom setups or paid tools if they get the job done. What are you guys using?

I know this is an old thread, but your problem is the exact same problem i have w/ off-the-shelf scrapers because they can't accurately pull variant data (like in-stock sizes/colors) because it all loads with JS.

The only reliable way is a custom setup that acts like a real user. Curious if you ever found a tool that actually got the job done?

I'm sure there are plenty of DIY scrapers but there's cool free tools out there like:

Price2Spy for basic price monitoring

Prisync like you mentioned, decent on pricing but a bit limited

Particl which goes beyond just pricing and lets you see competitor sales
