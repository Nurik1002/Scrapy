How are eCommerce founders actually using web scraping in 2025?
Been deep-diving into how founders are getting creative with scraping lately — and it’s way beyond price monitoring now.

Some folks are mining Amazon or Alibaba to spot trending products before they blow up. Others scrape competitor stock data to time promotions or even detect supply chain hiccups. One clever trick I saw: scraping checkout widgets to capture live shipping rates + ETAs by ZIP, then tweaking promo banners city-by-city. Apparently, that alone cut cart abandonment by 8%.

There’s also the whole SEO side — pulling product metadata and keywords to reverse-engineer what’s driving your rivals’ organic traffic. Even sentiment scraping reviews to understand what customers actually care about before launching something new.

What’s wild is how accessible this stuff’s become. Between APIs, proxy pools, and tools like Playwright or N8N, even small teams are running data pipelines that used to need enterprise budgets.

Curious — if you’re running an ecom brand or working on something similar, what’s the most interesting or underrated way you’ve seen scraping being used lately? What’s been working (or failing) for you?

Love this breakdown. Lately seeing founders scrape TikTok/Reddit trends to spot viral products early. Pairing that with review sentiment scraping gives scary-good insights into what’ll actually sell next month.

Tbh a sneaky one I’ve been loving is MAP-violation scraping. Crawl every listing of your brand across Walmart, eBay, random Shopify stores, flag anyone dipping under the floor price, auto-email the screenshots to the rep. Needs chill residential IPs or you get 429’d fast. Been running it with MagneticProxy, set sticky=10m so cookies stay fresh and captchas just… stopped. Also tossing the feed into a GPT-3.5 script that drafts the cease and desist copy on the fly. Anyone else playing with compliance scraping or am I just petty?
