websites.
r/webscraping - I vibe coded an ecommerce web scraper to scrape from +32 websites.
Hey everyone 👋

I built a web scraper for my e-commerce store and wanted to share how I solved a few scraping challenges.

Engine Detection
My scraper can automatically detect which platform a website is using for example, Shopify, WooCommerce, or another platform. Each platform has a different HTML structure, so the scraper detects the engine first, then uses the correct method to extract data.
This saves me a lot of time because I scrape data from many suppliers. Before, I had to manually check each website’s structure and it took too long.

How I Handle reCAPTCHA
This is my favorite part when the scraper encounters reCAPTCHA, it doesn’t use paid services or try to bypass it with bots (which gets you banned quickly). Instead, the scraper pauses and gives me remote access via noVNC.
The browser runs inside a Docker container. When a captcha appears, I get a notification, open noVNC in my browser, solve the captcha manually in 10 seconds, and the scraper continues automatically. No API fees, no bans everything stays safe.
It’s not 100% automatic, but most websites only show captchas occasionally. I solve maybe 2–3 per day instead of paying hundreds of dollars per month for captcha-solving services.

Technical Stack
Everything runs in Docker. I use Selenium/Playwright for browser automation, and the noVNC container lets me access the browser remotely whenever I need to solve a captcha. Everything is self-hosted, so I don’t pay for cloud scrapers or third-party services.

Is anyone doing something similar? Or do you have a better way to handle captchas?

What if you receive a CAPTCHA while you’re sleeping? (Otherwise, this is a super cool project, wishing you success)

It's good to hear. For recaptchas, you can use chrome extensions which are free to use. They solve recaptcha using trained AI models. It will be beneficial for you is you are relying on browser automation.

If you scroll down this web scraping community on reddit, you will see a post in which a person made such an extension. I personally tried it and that was very fast and accurate as compared to others.
