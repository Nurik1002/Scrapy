Can we please not put pictures into the posts. I've tried 3 different text editor on my phone to clean up the added text and pics before decoding. The pictures seem to turn a simple copy/paste into a more complicated process. TIA

Haha

I think the Linux one can work with Mac

It’s Python, I believe it’ll work

I don’t have a Mac device to personally test it

I think the quickest fix maybe is to try different domain or server

You can share the creds you find in my DM, I'll check to see what is up

ya if you wanna do macs just build a config that does the handshake, token, all that fun stuff and add in keychecks, parsers, and make it so it either saves hits to a file, the db, or do a webhook (i like to make it so it spits them out into discord so i can leave it running at home and get hits all in one place on my phone). Use the debugger to get all that sorted it helps to use a known working mac/host so you know what the postitive result will look like.

Gotta use proxies or a block is likely, but OB makes it easy to paste an api link from a scraper and it just updates/verifies them on its own instead of manually verifying and pruning your proxy list. Sorry this is a mess but its a lot easier than it sounds.

Hello

Unfortunately, one of the sub best guy to refer to, u/ceme3001 is banned or shadow-banned by Reddit

I didn't get to study it deeply enough

Maybe some members of the sub can help you

You are welcome to post a discussion thread

As long as you discuss it privately and not publicly on the sub home feed
