How on earth are major companies scraping data when it violates almost every terms of use?
Our competitors have thousands of lists of info. We have no idea how they could gather this much data without scraping and violating terms! is there a loophole?

Their info is publicly available data. Do we think they are just breaching the terms and saying that they can't trace that information to them since there are too many sources with that information? Playing the card that they are too big to sue?

We don't want to get into any trouble messing with the bigger players. Would also hope to be able to exit in the future, and not have any legality issues that buyers away and our value down.

Any ideas? anyone who works in this space have any insight?

Scraping the open web has been deemed legal in court. LinkedIn fought it and lost.

This is false. LinkedIn lost at first but brought the case to the supreme court and eventually won it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn

I think you're misinterpreting what happened. The ninth circuit stated that public scraping does not violate the CFAA since there was no "unauthorized access" in the scraping of public data. It was appealed in the supreme court, who sent it back down to the ninth circuit to reconsider based on some additional concepts (i.e. Van Buren v. United States) . The ninth circuit reiterated their original ruling that scraping public data is not a violation of the CFAA. There was a settlement between LinkedIn & HiQ - we don't know the details of that - but nonetheless the precedent of scraping public data being legal did not change.

If you are a judge, how do you find a reasonable price for damages? The scraping company says $0 and the creator/host says $100 billion. The only people who can put numbers behind it are Getty Images who is still stuck battling it out in court and the actors guild who went on strike to stop it. Everyone else is mostly screwed. This tech favorable administration will certainly tip the scale in their favor if they have the opportunity.

I don't know the legal stuff. But if it's publicly available then it should be free to transform or used as fair use in my mind. And training a model goes under transformation.

I personally find the pirating of books that meta did much more concerning. If they are not legally free then they should have bought them if they wanted to use it for training. If those were all illegally downloaded books then they should be fined the same amount per book as the single mom fit fined per song she downloaded, plus 20 years of inflation.

No. It's closer to recording music to learn from it. But if they sell the collected data then there might be an issue. But using it for training is transformative and no different from you reading an article and learning from it.

Countries that require training data to have consent from the creators are going to lose out in the ai revolution to countries that don't require it. Just like how those that started the industrial revolution first got a huge step up so will those that embrace the ai revolution.

This is one of those “everyone knows it’s happening, but no one talks about it” situations.

The reality is, big companies aren’t necessarily scraping in the way most people think. Many of them use a mix of:

Third-party data brokers – Companies that legally (or semi-legally) aggregate public data and sell it. It’s not technically scraping if you’re buying from someone else who’s already done the dirty work.

APIs and loopholes – Some platforms have APIs that, while limited, can be cleverly used to extract way more data than intended. There are also partnerships where companies “share” data under the guise of collaborations.

Gray-hat methods – Think of hiring contractors or using offshore firms that operate in a “don’t ask, don’t tell” way. If things go south, plausible deniability kicks in.

Legal muscle – When you’re big enough, platforms don’t ban you—they work with you. Some companies negotiate data access, and those who get caught scraping might just settle and move on.

If you’re trying to compete but stay clean, you’ve got options. You could focus on publicly available but structured data—stuff that’s been shared in reports, forums, and niche databases. Second, think about user-generated contributions (crowdsourcing). Some companies build the same datasets simply by incentivizing users to input the info.

I’ve seen startups get away with light scraping by respecting rate limits, mimicking human behavior, and not being greedy—but there’s always risk. If your goal is an exit, you don’t want a data skeleton in your closet.

Curious—have you tried reaching out to someone in M&A to see how buyers view these “gray areas”?

Could be interesting to hear what actually kills deals in this space.

This is helpful. I like the USG crowdsourcing idea or the third party brokers. From what I've learned these seem to be the only ways to do it the cleanest.

I have a mentor who sold a big B2B SaaS company (also is a serial entrepreneur), if it's not clean it most likely will be killed—nobody wants a lawsuit and not against big players. The goal is the exit.

I do actually have a big PwC contact in M&A. I will ask if I hear back soon I'll give an update... but I'm assuming he would say the same.

I love the Luminati logo. They changed names but use to be the best provider for residential proxies. Was hard to get vetted by them though, you basically had to be a web scraper exclusively.

ToS is not legally binding in most jurisdictions so thats the real answer to the question.

You don't agree to terms simply by browsing a website. You agree to terms when you sign up or fill out a contract.

So if content is publicly available, you can access it without agreeing to terms of service, and thus you can scrape it.

If you have to login to access the data, then terms of service applies and you might be in violation of terms if you scrape it.

How did LinkedIn win in Supreme Court then? In my understanding if you are just browsing or scraping aka “using” you are automatically agreeing to their TOS. Or correct me with a legal document somewhere lol

They didn't win in the supreme court. The supreme court sent it back down to the ninth circuit for reconsideration. The ninth circuit basically reaffirmed their original stance that scraping public data was not a violation of the CFAA.

There was some sort of settlement but the rulings still show that public scraping is not illegal. It's possible the settlement had something to do with blocking future scraping, which is something they can do.

Depending on what type of scraping you're looking at, something you may want to consider is Amazon's common crawl. They effectively scrape the internet every N months and share the file.

Protect your data by making it only visible to users who are authenticated and authorized.

If you’re making your data publicly available, it’s absurd to think that someone else wouldn’t use it, and they would be completely legally justified in doing so.
