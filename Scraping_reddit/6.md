I built a tool that tells you how hard a website is to scrape
Showcase
UPDATE:
Website is now live!

Try it now: https://www.caniscrape.org

- No installation required

- Instant analysis

- Same comprehensive checks as the CLI

NOTE:
I haven't added the flag capabilities yet so its just the default scan. Its also still one link at a time, so all the great ideas I've received for the website will come soon (I'm gonna keep working on it). It'll take about 1-3 days but ill make it a lot better for the V1.0.0 release.

CLI still available on GitHub for those who prefer it.

Hi everyone,
I made a Python package called caniscrape that analyzes any website's anti-bot protections before you start scraping.

It tells you what you're up against (Cloudflare, rate limits, JavaScript rendering, CAPTCHAs, TLS fingerprinting, honeypots) and gives you a difficulty score + specific recommendations.

What My Project Does
caniscrape checks a website for common anti-bot mechanisms and reports:

A difficulty score (0–10)

Which protections are active (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai, hCaptcha, etc.)

What tools you’ll likely need (headless browsers, proxies, CAPTCHA solvers, etc.)

Whether using a scraping API might be better

This helps you decide the right scraping approach before you waste time building a bot that keeps getting blocked.

Target Audience
Web scrapers, data engineers, and researchers who deal with protected or dynamic websites

Developers who want to test bot-detection systems or analyze site defenses

Hobbyists learning about anti-bot tech and detection methods

It’s not a bypassing or cracking tool — it’s for diagnostics and awareness.

Comparison
Unlike tools like WAFW00F or WhatWaf, which only detect web application firewalls,
caniscrape runs multi-layered tests:

Simulates browser and bot requests (via Playwright)

Detects rate limits, JavaScript challenges, and honeypot traps

Scores site difficulty based on detection layers

Suggests scraping strategies or alternative services

So it’s more of a pre-scrape analysis toolkit, not just a WAF detector.

Installation
pip install caniscrape
Quick setup (required):

playwright install chromium  # Download browser
pipx install wafw00f         # WAF detection
Example Usage
caniscrape https://example.com
Output includes:

Difficulty score (0–10)

Active protections

Recommended tools/approach

ADVICE:
Results can vary between runs because bot protections adapt dynamically.
Some heavy-protection sites (like Amazon) may produce these varied results. Of course, this will improve over time, but running the command multiple times can mitigate this.

Honestly a website seems like a better fit for this. I'm way more likely to try going to your website and copying and pasting a url into a box than I am to pip install and run unknown code on my machine

And then you could have some ads on the site for a small amount of extra money

There's value in having a local tool. It answers how hard is it for me to scrape it, vs the website servers - accounting for my country/isp etc.

Yeah that’s a good idea, I did the CLI first as popular scrapers like Scrapy work in the terminal as well, so I just thought it’d be easier. If others have the same suggestion as you, I’ll start working on a website right away

I agree, a website would be nice, but if it’s only a few websites then it’s not too bad to figure out yourself. There are times where a stakeholder may give you an excel sheet with 100s of domains to scrape and it’s a pain figuring out the little nuances of each one. Filtering that list into easy, medium, and hard is a quick way to show a PM impact and blockers.

In a future update I’ll definitely add a way to paste a bunch of links (or import an Excel/CSV file on a website) and return it in a easy to read format, I know that’s one of the biggest blockers I have right now. Pasting a bunch of links at once and running them all at the same time would save a crazy amount of time

I haven't added the flag capabilities yet so its just the default scan. Its also still one link at a time, so all the great ideas I've received for the website will come soon (I'm gonna keep working on it).

I do 4 probe requests first (just single requests but four in a row) and then I do 8 requests in a burst. The burst is low for more advanced websites that don’t really check rate limiting but request volume, so I’ll likely add a flag that lets you set burst request size to make it more adaptable. And thanks!

Maybe you just haven’t mentioned it but shouldn’t the first point of call for a web scraping analyser be looking at robots.txt. Unless the goal is to intentionally disregard it

Since websites that care usually set up some form of API for gathering data, and given all of the methods of bypass that exist (captcha solvers etc.) I would say that in most cases of scraping, the goal is to intentionally disregard what the website wants you to do

I actually purposely set up my tests to go in order, I do look for the robots.txt first. But you are right, what you are saying is that I disregard the robots.txt anyway. I should create a for --force flag instead, thanks for the suggestion!

gocomics recently jumped up a level of complexity. I used to scrape the five comics I like into a single page. They've gone to a page requiring Javascript to get the content. Not an insurmountable task in Python, but I don't have time for it at the moment.

My tool only gives you suggestions on how to workaround certain blocks that websites have like JavaScript. For example, if all they have is JavaScript rendering, then you can just use Playwright (which is also a dependency that’s automatically downloaded with caniscrape). I can’t do the hard work for you, but I can tell you how to make that work easier and save time

Hmm idk about this, its probably not a 10/10 but Amazon will 100% implement multiple different strategies to block bots if you scrape it repeatedly from the same ip, and your website is giving it a score of 0/10

I wrote this in the post, I know its a problem I have to fix. I'm gonna continue to keep working on it and make it more accurate.

tbh amazon bot protections is likely 9 or 10/10, just cuz they're essentially the largest online retailer, and competition is fierce. They have so many unorthodox bot protections that its just showing up as a 0

Same boat here, u/JackedIvyLeaguer. Amazon showed 0/10 for me too until I ran the check behind a residential hop. Turns out caniscrape sees a datacenter IP and shrugs, but the moment you hit it from a ‘real’ home IP the WAF rules crank up and the score spikes. I’ve been testing with MagneticProxy (rotates legit household IPs, sticky option for login flows) and the diff is wild. There’s a free 100req tier if you just wanna experiment. Let me know if that flips your numbers 👀

I checked wafw00f docs (which is what I use for WAF scanning) and it seems Anubis or Cerebrus isn't supported. I'll likely have to manually add support for missing WAFs as people request it.

You will be able to log into the website with any account you want (whether you want it to represent you or not). The only way your "cover can be blown" is using your personal IP, which you can mask using a VPN or proxy rotation. Hope that helps!

This is great OP, I just happened to see this yesterday and then had a potential scraping project come up today.

Of 6 sites I was looking at your tool (in python, I haven't tried your website yet) identified 4 sites with reCAPTCHA protection but manual testing revealed the CAPTCHA was dormant - all sites were accessible with simple requests. This false positive actually worked in our favor by making us proceed more cautiously.

In your experience, when sites show CAPTCHA in scans but don't enforce it during normal access, what are the most common reasons? Are there specific patterns that distinguish 'decorative' CAPTCHA from actively enforced protection?

Thanks for building this - I love the proactive reconnaissance approach.

It’s actually crazy to think about, but websites have invisible captchas. They determine whether you “seem” like a bot first and then serve you the captcha. The thing is, these always have to present in the website which is why my tool can detect them but you don’t see it, unless you manually trigger the rate limit or click really fast on stuff, etc.

It would be great if you could allow the results to be emailed or submitted to a central place, where they could be collated and displayed to a website (that also advertises a download link for your program - for more "individual" results).

Note this feature to upload/send in results in should 100% be an opt-in option.

No. I mean when someone runs your program and gets results, they get an option to upload or email the results for that website to you (or some collector service - that could be an API with PUT command or a manual extraction of the data from an email, which you place into a DB).

You can then have a website that allows users to enter a domain or URL, that queries against your API/DB, giving the user results of users' various tests run against that site (with dates). Alongside those results, you could display the option to download your program - so the user can provide their own results or to "survey" more sites.

Ah so you mean like test against the history of a website. I could integrate that into my website itself no? Or do you not think that's the right call. Just whenever the user opts in to adding their data to the large "aggregate" of that specific site, I can display your results currently as well as what people have done in the past. Yeah that's a great idea and it'll keep you up to date and how often a website changes their defenses.

Opt-in result uploads plus a simple public dashboard/API would make this way more useful and trustworthy.

Capture a minimal JSON on submit: eTLD+1, optional path hash, timestamp, country/ASN, proxy type (residential/datacenter/mobile), browser/OS, caniscrape and Playwright versions, headless yes/no, signals found (WAF vendor, captcha type, JS challenge, rate-limit window, HTTP codes), and retries. Strip cookies, query params, and any tokens; hash client IP but keep ASN. Version every field so results are comparable across releases.

On the backend, dedupe by domain+version+signal set, weight by sample size, and show a confidence score. Surface a timeline per domain so people can see when protections changed, plus a matrix view by proxy type and browser mode. For the MVP: POST /v1/runs with an API key and HMAC to prevent spam; accept an email fallback that attaches the same JSON. Add basic moderation and throttle per source.

I use Scrapy Cloud for scheduled crawls and Bright Data to compare proxy categories, and DomainGuard when I need alerts on WAF/captcha flips across domains.

Ship opt-in uploads, a public dashboard, and versioned, anonymized telemetry, and this becomes a go-to pre-scrape check.

Damn I just saw this, thanks for putting so much effort into the comment. Ill definitely add all of that. I'm lowkey taking a break from the website for right now though, maybe like a week, to actually ship v1.0.0 of the CLI (which is what I use on the backend of the website anyway so it benefits that as well). I don't think I can work on the website until I resolve the main challenge of accurately describing big names like Amazon and YouTube, but I'm working on an AI that will be able to prove to users that they are indeed using behavioral detection. I have already added detection for enterprise bot detection services/canvas fingerprinting as well as browser integrity analysis (to see if the JS has been tampered with) in v0.3.0. But as soon as I get this down, I'll for sure add everything you just said.

The truth is you can break almost all of it. Whether its mimmicking human behavior to trick cloudflare, busting is it came with opencv, tesseract and opencv for entry, gemini or claude for tougher problems , or a million tiny hands solving the worst captchas, its all doable. Take out llms and add in machine learning and you have first job way back in 2014.

The site does also check for rate limits, but I lowkey have to adjust the way it does it cuz most websites have a request limit rather than a rate limit. Also websites don’t really block IPs unless they’re really suspicious, like it doesn’t seem like someone would logically access their website with that IP.
