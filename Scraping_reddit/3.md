Best web scraping tools I’ve tried (and what I learned from each)
I’ve gone through quite a few tools over the past couple of years while scraping for side projects and client work. Each one has its place, but also a few trade-offs:

Selenium: Simple to get started with, but felt clunky once projects grew bigger.

Scrapy: Super fast on static sites, though adding support for dynamic content took extra work.

Apify: Solid infrastructure and prebuilt actors, but heavier than I needed for smaller jobs.

Browserless: Clean for headless sessions, but I hit reliability bumps under higher load.

Playwright: Great for structured automation and testing, though a bit code-heavy for lightweight scraping.

Hyperbrowser: The one I’m using most now. It’s been steadier on long runs and handles messy sites more gracefully, so I spend less time patching scripts and more time working with the data.

That’s my stack so far. What tools are you finding actually hold up once you move beyond the demo phase?

Oxylabs’ new Google Fast Search API did the job well. I use it to feed data into a chatbot and haven’t had any weird delays or timeout issues so far.

May I ask sth about the chatbot? Did u develop it by urself or also got provided by someone like Oxylabs?
I was thinking about a similar solution tbh. Would be very grateful!

For all the heavy JS sites, I've found HasD⁤ata's AP⁤I simpler than running my own Playwright.

Anchor is one of the browsers that has been steadier for me on long scrapes since it keeps sessions alive

Nice breakdown. I’ve had a similar experience with Apify - the prebuilt actors save me a ton of setup time, especially when I don’t feel like reinventing the wheel for scraping Google Maps or e-commerce sites.

With Hyperbrowser holding up well for you on messy sites, do you find yourself still reaching for Apify’s infra for bigger jobs, or has Hyperbrowser fully replaced it in your stack?

half the “dies after demo” pain you’re describing is the IP stack, not the framework. Once a site flags your datacenter range everything gets flaky and it looks like the browser lib is the culprit. I stopped babysitting scripts after switching to rotating residential proxies (using MagneticProxy rn). Real home IPs, auto rotate per request or sticky, city-level geo so the session still looks human. Plugged it into Playwright with a single line and those JS-heavy pages quit rage-quitting. It’s pricier than bare datacenter socks but cheaper than rewriting selectors every week.

Founder of Riveter (YC F24) here 🙋‍♂️ We have a lot of customers that have stopped using scrapers because we cover the end-to-end scraping workflow (SERP, proxies, browser infra, etc.)

With Riveter, you can configure input data, write prompts for the information you want returned, and what format you want it in. Then our agents will search, perform browser use, and return a high quality answer.

It's helped a lot of teams spin up their AI projects faster. I'd be super curious to hear what some of you here think, since you're used to building with scrapers. We have a free tier if you want to give it a try.

Let me know if you want to be an early user of the API

Olostep has been the best web AI scraping and crawling tool for me. For smaller projects where I need flexibility at the code level I use the Olostep API but otherwise I can just prompt to automate any data collection process on the browser

this is a solid breakdown, especially the point about tools breaking down after the demo phase. thats where most of these comparisons fall short tbh. i've had similar experiences with most of these, particularly the selenium clunkiness as projects scale and scrapy needing tons of extra work for anything dynamic. the browserless reliability issues under load are real too, ran into that exact problem when we tried scaling up our scraping operations.

your experience with hyperbrowser matches what i've been hearing from other people dealing with long-running sessions. the session stability thing seems to be where a lot of tools just fall apart, especially when youre dealing with complex workflows that can't afford to restart every 30 minutes. curious how it handles the really messy sites with heavy javascript and frequent DOM changes? those are usually the ones that break even the more robust setups

Such a great list! I have created, built, and managed scraped data automations at almost every startup I've worked at. The two that I've used the most are Apify, and Browse AI (I work there full disclosure).

Did you consider Browse AI? No code, free to get started, and uses to ai to adapt the code when websites change so your data stays accurate. You can also set up monitors, and integrate the data almost anywhere.

Help please...
I want to scrape all the posts about generative AI from my university's website. The results should include at least the publication date, publication link, and publication text.
I really appreciate any help you can provide.

Why not ask Chatgpt to do that for you? You may need the paid version with deep research capability but there are a lot of websites that offer chatgpt5 for free but may be limited. Just google them.

There is one thing you’re mixing up here though: you’re bunching up headless browser libraries with web scraping API Providers.

For example, Selenium, Scrapy, and Playwright are more of headless browser libraries.

That said, what you have experienced is valid.

And here is the thing: Everything always looks good at demo, till you add more load, and it breaks.

This is why it’s often better to stress-test these tools during demo, so you’ll know which one can deliver the amount of compute you work with.

BS4 is a non-browser scraper, which means it is limited. It can't scrape any Java code whereas the ones mentioned in this thread are browser-based scrapers which can find Java based code and scrape the data.

Our team uses Oxylabs residential proxies with their scraper API. No headache dealing with blocks or weird edge cases, and I could plug it into whatever tool we'r already using

Playwright's code bloat is real, feels like overkill for basic pulls sometimes, especially when sites throw anti-bot curveballs. For data crawling on the regular, I half-jokingly tried Infatica's Custom Scraper as a band-aid after Browserless flaked out on me mid-project - it handles logins and geo-blocks via ethical proxies way smoother than expected, outputting to CSV without drama. Still, pair it with something lightweight like Scrapy for static stuff to avoid complete dependency, but it's a solid partial fix for those production headaches you mentioned

web scraping topic wouldn't be complete without getting data from social media content and e-commerce.

here I'd recommend APIs like Supadata, ScrapingDog, ScrapeCreators.

Has anyone tried autom. dev & Scrapingdog's Google Search API? Both have good response time, as well reasonable pricing, atleast better than what other commentators have mentioned here.

This one is very nice for an AI / LLM scraper. It will cache the page layout on the first load, then every page load after that (assuming you pull the same data) scrapes much faster, and it will adapt automatically to website changes:

Search for "Universal LLM Scraper" on Apify

Hey, really liked your breakdown! Totally agree about Selenium - I’ve been using it for a while too, and it’s great to get started, but once projects grow bigger, it can feel a bit clunky 😅.

Due to my business needs, I’ve tried quite a few web scraping solutions, and tbh, I realized that having a stable infrastructure often matters waaaay more than the framework itself 😅. Recently, I gave this tool called Scrapeless a try, and wow - it really handles long-running sessions like a champ! Even on pages super heavy with JS or full of captchas.... Before that, I was spending tons of time babysitting scripts or dealing with IP issues… total nightmare for bigger projects 😩.Has anyone else run into the same thing?
