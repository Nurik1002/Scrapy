Scraping best practices to anti-bot detection?
Getting started 🌱
I’ve used scrappy, playwright, and selenium. All sent to be detected regularly. I use a pool of 1024 ip addresses, different cookie jars, and user agents per IP.

I don’t have a lot of experience with Typescript or Python, so using C++ is preferred but that is going against the grain a bit.

I’ve looked at potentially using one of these:

https://github.com/Kaliiiiiiiiii-Vinyzu/patchright-nodejs

Anyone have any tips for a persons just getting into this?

Bots UA can (and are many times) blocked just by robots.txt

I'd recommend researching fingerprinting and understanding how its used to block you.

WIth that in mind your generally stuck with Python or JS imo there are just way more useful packages. These are Python ones I've used and recommend:

rnet or curl_cffi as your http request package (sends good browserlike fingerprint and TLS)

Camoufox or Nodriver/Zendriver as a browser

Camofoux maintainer has a medical issue and has been hospitalized since March 2025. All his projects are frozen.

However, I also recommend curl_ffi and nodriver/zendriver

If Python works for you, try Playwright Stealth. It patches common automation fingerprints and slips past most basic bot checks.

Playwright stealth is easily caught. You're better off using Chrome and CDP directly with common command line flags to avoid leaving traces.

For example:

// Set your debugging port to one that is not the default
`--remote-debugging-port=${this.debugPort}`,
// Don't trigger the first run logic in chrome
'--no-first-run',
// Ensure you can store the user data somewhere (and potentially re-use)
`--user-data-dir=${this.chromeUserDataDir}`,
// Allow contacting any origin like `localhost`
'--remote-allow-origins=*',

I noticed that. The package patchright-nodejs is a TS version of a patched Playwright that is supposed to improve upon Playwright Stealth. Or at least, that is what I took from the repo's readme. Have you used patchright-Python compared to Playwright-Stealth?

Didn’t compare them side by side, but from what I’ve seen, Patchright handles detection a bit better. Playwright Stealth was just the first thing that came to mind, old habits and all that

Unless you patch playwright . selenium, they are easily detectable off the shelf, they basically annouce "I am being automated".

Playwright with the patchright patches will sort that for you.

ulixee hero I've heard good things about, but not used and has it's own api for doing things. Playwright more widely used and will be able to get more help with it

so using C++ is preferred but that is going against the grain a bit.

IF you prefer c++, try c# you're not going to find many libraries for c++ in all honesty, you won't even find as many in c# as you do python or JS, but there will be some, unlike C++ where there will be none.

c# language can be thought of as a simple C++, is compiled and has similar notation. Whereas python / js are very different

+1 for patchright. You might even need some other things, keeping SSL pinning and other fingerprints in mind

I use Puppeteer + real Chrome browser in such cases.

Just spoofing useragent is not enough. You have to study about fingerprinting and how proxy works. Take a look at these articles: https://pydoll.tech/docs/deep-dive/fingerprinting/

I'll check it out, but I find Typescript easier to handle than Python.

If I use AWS Lambda is there basically no way around it without some custom VPC or something since all those IP ranges are known?

Use proxies. There are many open/free proxies published. There are also paid residential proxies to get "good" IP blocks lists.

Js is the best, I never seen any framework better than DomParser which can easy to query the target element in html.

Spoof the user agent. The default is python-requests and this will get you blocked

I do, since 2014. I tended to go to sites with user agents and use the top ten. But that’s not cutting it now a days.

Sites require logins. So clearing cookies requires re-logging in

Not sure why no one is mentioning it ^^'

But you can simply launch a real chrome from the command line

e.g. something like that

/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome 
--remote-debugging-port=39405 
--no-first-run 
--no-default-browser-check 
--disable-gpu 
--password-store=basic 
--proxy-server=127.0.0.1:39404 
--user-data-dir=/Users/administrator/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/my_profile --disable-renderer-accessibility 
--disable-translate 
--disable-infobars 
--disable-notifications 
--disable-popup-blocking 
--disk-cache-size=10485760 
--media-cache-size=1048576 
--disable-application-cache 
--disable-cache 
--disable-dev-shm-usage
With python you can launch the browser on a port easy with pychrome — not sure for C++

It's like launching a real chrome browser — there is 0 fingerprinting

I have been working through scraping best practices and switched to using mastra because it integrates with browser automation and handles typical anti-bot hurdles in a cleaner way

If Scrapy / Playwright / Selenium are getting you flagged even with 1,024 IPs + cookie jars, that’s normal. Modern anti-bot systems don’t just look at IPs anymore — they score things like:

TLS/JA3 fingerprints

Canvas/WebGL fingerprints

Timing & behavior

IP reputation

And a lot more

So even with big proxy pools, your browser fingerprint often stays identical → instant detection.

Tools worth trying
Besides Hero and Patchright:

curl-cffi (Python) — mimics real Chrome TLS fingerprints; very good for bypassing basic detection.

Playwright Stealth / playwright-extra — patches headless signals + JS APIs.

Camoufox — stealth-optimized Firefox build.
