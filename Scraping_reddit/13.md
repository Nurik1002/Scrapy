Besides price monitoring and tracking competitor inventory, another common use case is scraping entire Shopify stores to pull all product data in a ready-to-import format. Dropshippers use this a lot to clone product catalogs

Price monitoring is just the tip of the iceberg honestly.

Most ecomm founders I know are getting creative with scraping beyond just competitor pricing. Product research is huge.. scraping marketplaces like Amazon or Alibaba to identify trending products, analyze review sentiment, or find suppliers. Inventory tracking is another big one where they monitor competitor stock levels to time their own promotions or identify supply chain issues. Content scraping for product descriptions and specs saves tons of manual work, especially for dropshippers who need to populate catalogs quickly. Some are scraping social media for user generated content or influencer posts featuring their products.

The more technical founders use it for SEO competitive analysis, scraping competitor product pages to see what keywords theyre targeting or how they structure their metadata. At Notte we see a lot of demand for reliable scraping since many founders start with basic scripts but quickly hit rate limits or get blocked, then need something more robust that can handle the anti bot measures that major sites deploy. The key is being strategic about what data actually moves the needle for your business rather than just collecting everything you can access.

Love the product-research angle u dropped. One trick I don't see here: scrape the checkout widget to grab real time shipping rates + ETAs your rivals show per ZIP. Toss that into a matrix with your own 3PL locations and you can auto-tweak shipping fees or promo banners city by city. Cut my cart abandon by 8% last Q tbh.

If you test it, avoid DC proxies. Shopify + Cloudflare flags them instantly rn. I'm on MagneticProxy’s residential pool, sticky 5-min sessions, 0 captchas over ~50k calls this month. Cheap af and no setup drama.
